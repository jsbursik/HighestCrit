# Highest Crit Addon

This is a very simple addon that when the conditions are met a sound will play and the text will bounce/flash to notify you that you've hit a new highest crit.

`/hcrit` opens the options panel for you to customize the Font, Position, and Sound settings. All the settings are profile specific, and the crit amount is character specific.

## Stuff I still want to implement:

- [ ] Add the option to show the spell icon and spell name of what dealt the crit
- [ ] Fade the text out after a duration if desired
- [ ] Crit Scoreboard maybe?
